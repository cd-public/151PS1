# Problem Set 1

- [ ] Submitted?

_Please insert an x in the square brackets above to mark the assignment as submitted!_


## Instructions:
The pdf has all the basic instructions, but here are some additional guidelines.
- [ ] Code for Problem 1 should be done in the file called `Prob1.py` in the repository. This is another Karel program and has additional worlds called `1x8.w`, `5x5.w`, `5x3.w`, and `8x1.w`. 
- [ ] Code for Problem 2 should be done in the file called `Prob2.py`. The template is very sparse here on purpose, as you are defining the desired functions.
- [ ] Code for Problem 3 should be done in `Prob3.py`! The template here just has a single function that you should add your code to.

Please remember to fill out the meta-information at the top of each file! At the very least, be clear about if you worked with anyone.

If you have issues or come across problems or parts of the instructions that are unclear, please don't hesitate to ask on Discord or via Campuswire or email or in person!
